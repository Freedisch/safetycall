# SAFETYCALL

An emergency alert application.

## INTRODUCTION

This application is designed to provide assistance in times of emergency, specifically targeting individuals who are susceptible to falls and require immediate help. The app employs automated fall detection technology by utilizing pre-installed cameras in user's, and manual alert mechanisms to ensure swift alert to pre-selected contacts.

## Impact
- **Improved safety**: The real-time monitoring and alert system provided by the app helps to reduce the risk of falls and other accidents, keeping vulnerable individuals safer and reducing the likelihood of serious injury.
- **Faster response time**: The app triggers an alert and sends notifications to designated emergency contacts in case of any danger or injury, which allows for a faster response time and more effective response.
  
- **Increased efficiency**: Using cloud-based machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques allow the app to analyze the user's movements and detect any signs of danger without constant human supervision.
  
- **Better patient care**: In a hospital setting, the app could be used to monitor patients and alert nurses if they are in danger of falling or if their vital signs indicate that they need medical attention. This could lead to improved patient care, reduced medical costs, and faster recovery times.
  
- **Peace of mind for families and caregivers**: The app provides families and caregivers with peace of mind, knowing that their loved ones are being monitored and protected and that they will be immediately notified in case of any danger or emergency.

## FEATURES

- **Camera-based Fall Detection**: The app utilizes installed cameras in the user's house to detect falls automatically. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who are prone to falling due to health conditions.
  
- **Manual Alert Button**: Users can also manually trigger alerts by pressing a dedicated button within the mobile application interface. This allows for quick and easy communication with emergency contacts when needed.
  
- **Contact List Management**: Users can pre-select a list of emergency contacts within the app. These contacts will receive notifications in case of an emergency, ensuring that help can be swiftly summoned.

- **Location Sharing**: The app can share the user's location with emergency contacts, helping responders locate them quickly in case of an emergency.

## USAGE

- **Fall Detection**: Allow pre-installed cameras to monitor your movements while you go about your daily activities. If a fall is detected, the app will automatically trigger an alert to your emergency contacts.

- **Manual Alert**: In case of an emergency that does not involve a fall, open the app and press the manual alert button. This will immediately notify your chosen emergency contacts of the situation.

- **Response**: Once an alert is triggered, your emergency contacts will receive notifications according to your configured preferences. Responders can then take appropriate action to assist you.
